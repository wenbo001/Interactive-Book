//TO DO
- Add comments where necessary
- Implement smile detection (ofxSmile)
- Find a way to override the "system() is not a function issue", maybe find a different way or include a specific C++ library?
- Do more research on Regex (mid sentence, merged words)
- find a way to open the browser cross platform (iPad, Windows).
- Do more testing on other platforms. I wasn’t able to get Tesseract running properly on Windows (I didn’t try hard though).
- Add more options for user interaction: keyboard, mouse, gestures.
- Implement the possibilty of adding multiple versions of the same work like: "BASISBOEK WISKUNDE" and "BASISBOEKWISKUNDE" to increase the chance of success.

//OPTIONAL
//add cover interaction
